# COVIDcast (COVID-19) Epidemiological Data | Delphi Research Group (CMU)

You can subscribe to the AWS Data Exchange product utilizing the automation featured in this repository by visiting [https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uusmw5j7egnck](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uusmw5j7egnck). 

## Main Overview
This resource contains an archived collection of datasets from Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Research Group's COVID-19 Surveillance Streams Data (COVIDcast) - itself an endpoint in Delphi's Epidata open API for Epidemiological Data.

Delphi's COVIDcast datasets are based on a variety of data sources including **a CMU-run Facebook health survey, a Google-run health survey, lab test results provided by Quidel Inc, search data released by Google Health Trends, and outpatient doctor visits provided by a national health system**.

#### Data Source
The datasets in this product are delivered with descriptive S3 prefixes set to mirror the same parameters used when interacting directly with the COVIDcast API. A `file_format` parameter has been added as a base prefix to be able to easily navigate between the JSON Lines and CSV versions of this data.

`/<file_format>/<data_source>/< signal >/<time_type>/<geo_type>.<file_extension>`

For example, to access a JSON Lines file covering Facebook survey data for COVID-Like Illnesses (CLI) broken into daily entries by two-letter state codes, you would visit the file at the following path:

`/jsonl/fb-survey/raw_cli/day/state.jsonl`

Individual data entries include the following fields:

`geo_value` | `time_value` | `direction` | `value` | `stderr` | `sample_size`

To learn about the valid parameters and fields used in the Delphi's COVIDcast data, please visit the [COVIDcast API documentation](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html) and the [Delphi Epidata GitHub repository](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/delphi-epidata/blob/master/docs/api/covidcast.md) where this project is actively maintained.
